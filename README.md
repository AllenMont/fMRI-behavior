### Description
The aim of the paper is predicting behavioral traits using Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging brain scan connectome.
In particular, a multi-way array decomposition is
involved and the obtained matrices are used for classification
and regression tasks. The specific decomposition method
used in this study is a constrained version of PARAFAC2
model. The classification task focuses on gender and age,
the regression uses the subject-specific scores obtained by
PARAFAC2 in order to predict personality. The scores obtained
by the variant of the PARAFAC2 model can be actually
used to predict behavioral traits from the HCP data. Using
subject-specific scores from PARAFAC2 model cannot guarantee
a better result compared to an easier approach, e.g.,
making prediction using the correlogram.
